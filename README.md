# Netflix Review Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project explores the use of pre-trained BERT models for sentiment analysis of Netflix reviews on the Google Play Store. It leverages the google-bert/bert-base-cased model from Hugging Face to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Key Technologies:

 Hugging Face Transformers: Provides access to pre-trained BERT models and simplifies NLP tasks.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A powerful pre-trained model for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
Project Structure:

netflix_reviews.csv: CSV containing the Netflix review dataset (modify this path if different).
netflix-sentiment-analysis.ipynb: Notebook containing the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation (modify this path if different).
